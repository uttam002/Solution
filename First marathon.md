	inputs : 1.length of marathon in km								
	             2.Your starting speed  in km/hr								
	             3.Integer array for location of booster Dose e.g. [2,5,8,10]								
	             4.Integer array for Effectiveness of the booster dose station e.g. [5,8,12,9]								
	             5..Integer array for time to wait in minutes to avaiil e,g, [1,1,4,2]								
	Problem 1 : find minimum time to complete marathon with at most one booster dose. you can tack only one booster dose from one station.
